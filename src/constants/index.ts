  {
    q: "What is CryptoCoin (CC)?",
    a: "CryptoCoin is a deflationary ERC-20 token with a maximum supply of 27 million, mined using virtual GPUs within a gamified ecosystem. Its mechanics are inspired by Bitcoin's original supply and halving model.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I start mining?",
    a: "1) Acquire CC tokens via the private sale or Uniswap. 2) Use CC to buy a GPU directly or open a Mystery Box. 3) Once you own a GPU, it will start mining automatically. 4) You can claim your mined CC at any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a Mystery Box?",
    a: "A Mystery Box is a loot-box-style item that contains a random GPU. There are 4 rarities: Common (Rule 3434) 70%, Rare (Sapphire 1690) 25%, Epic (Subzero 8000) 4.5%, and Legendary (EmberGold6969) 0.5%.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are mining rewards calculated?",
    a: "Mining rewards depend on your GPU's hash power (10-100), time elapsed since last claim, and the global mining rate, which halves as more tokens are mined. More powerful GPUs and longer wait times earn more.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is halving in GPUmine?",
    a: "Halving is a mechanism where mining rewards are reduced by half after key milestones. The first halving happens at 13.5 million CC in circulation, following Bitcoin's pattern to ensure increasing scarcity over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use multiple GPUs?",
    a: "Yes! You can mine with up to 1 GPUs per transaction. Each GPU will generate its own rewards based on its individual power level.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell or transfer my GPUs?",
    a: "Absolutely! GPUs are NFTs and can be transferred, sold, or traded on any compatible NFT marketplace, giving you full ownership and control.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the mining really on-chain?",
    a: "Yes! All mining logic, reward distribution, halvings, and GPU ownership are handled 100% on-chain, ensuring complete transparency and decentralization.",
  },
